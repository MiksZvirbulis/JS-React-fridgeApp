# fridgeApp

## Purpose
While working on my React & Express portfolio, I decided to solve one of my own daily issues.
The trouble starts when having a shared fridge at home. Sitting on the train, bus or zipline and dreaming about a meal you plan on making in the evening, getting to the shop to pick up the ingredients and realising that you have no idea what you already have at home - fridge, cupboard or freezer. Do I already have this? If I did, did anyone at home use it already? Now, this is where my app comes in - it allows sharing ingredients across a household, editing their expiry date, name, weight and even their icon!

## Why go through all this trouble?
Mainly and most importantly - reduce food waste. However, it may also be for money saving purposes.
